reclass TODO
============

- Puppet adapter, whoever might want that…???
- Write unittest for everything but datatypes, incl. yaml_fs, outputters, CLI
  and adapters.
- Configurable file extension (.yaml/.yml, or support both)
- Verbosity options, debugging
- Add a configuration option to allow a set of classes to be slapped onto
  nodes by default (#5).
- Think about alternative implementations for Parameter interpolation, as
  DictPath and RefValue are a bit cumbersome. It works, but it's not exactly
  intuitive or pretty.
- Maybe a regexp→class mapping to allow massive numbers of nodes (e.g. web\d+)
  to be classified all at once, without requiring thousands of node-files to be
  created.
- Make data from CMS available to reclass
